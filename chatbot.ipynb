      " SCADA (Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition) is a system that collects data from various sensors at a factory, plant, or in other remote locations and sends this data to a central computer that then manages and controls the data.\n",
      "- SCADA is a term that is used broadly to portray control and management solutions in a wide range of industries.\n",
      "- Some of the industries where SCADA is used are Water Management Systems, Electric Power, Traffic Signals, Mass Transit Systems, Environmental Control Systems, and Manufacturing Systems.\n",
      "- There are many parts in a working SCADA system.\n",
      "- A SCADA system usually includes signal hardware (input and output), controllers, networks, user interface (HMI), communications equipment, and software.\n",
      "- All together, the term SCADA refers to the entire central system.\n",
      "- For the most part, the brains of a SCADA system are the Remote Terminal Units (RTU).\n",
      "- Most often, a SCADA system monitors and makes slight changes to function optimally.\n",
      "- SCADA systems are considered closed loop systems and run with relatively little human intervention.\n",
      "- One of SCADA’s key processes is its ability to monitor an entire system in real time.\n",
      "- SCADA can be seen as a system with many data elements called points.\n",
      "- Data elements from hard and soft points are always recorded and logged to create a time stamp or history A SCADA system includes a user interface called a Human Machine Interface (HMI).\n",
      "- The HMI of a SCADA system is where data is processed and presented to be viewed and monitored by a human operator.\n",
      "- This interface usually includes controls where the individual can interface with the SCADA system.\n",
      "- Because RTUs and PLCs historically had no standardized method to display or present data to an operator, the SCADA system communicates with PLCs throughout the system network and processes information that the HMI easily disseminates.\n",
      "- In the last decade, practically all SCADA systems include an integrated HMI and PLC device, making it extremely easy to run and monitor a SCADA system.\n",
      "- In the last decade, practically all SCADA systems include an integrated HMI and PLC device, making it extremely easy to run and monitor a SCADA system.\n",
      "- SCADA systems are an extremely advantageous way to run and monitor processes.\n",
      "- SCADA can come in open and non-proprietary protocols.\n",
      "- SCADA system software can also be easily configured for almost any application, removing the need for custom made or intensive software development.\n",
